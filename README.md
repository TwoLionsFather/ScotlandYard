# A Cops and Robbers game

This project is about finding a strategy to a boardgame. 
In the game one player is trying to escape from the others like a robber. 
The other players chase after him and try to move to the same location as the robber. 
They have limited resources and in most of the rounds only limited information about the robbers possible locations.

## Project Goal
Find a strategy where the robber always wins against the best possible players.
This goal requires perfect movement from the chasing players which is where most of the development effort goes towards.
